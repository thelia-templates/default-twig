 * assertion on its output can tell that it costs three hundred queries. Counting
 * them is the only way to keep a batched read batched: the tests state the budget
 * a screen is allowed, and going back to one query per row breaks them.
 *
 * Propel keeps the counter on the connection wrapper and only increments it in
 * debug mode, which is off by default. Every test on Thelia's IntegrationTestCase
 * runs with instance pooling disabled, so nothing is served from a previous test's

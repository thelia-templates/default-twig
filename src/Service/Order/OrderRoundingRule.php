 * How a line total is built from a unit amount and a quantity, for one order.

 * The core decides this per order, and the decision is durable on purpose: reading
 * an invoice back under a newer rule would restate an amount the customer has
 * already paid. Two configuration pivots freeze the orders that came before a
 * change of rule, and the rest follow the rule the shop runs today.
 *
 * The pivots and the mode are read raw through ConfigQuery::read() rather than
 * through ConfigQuery::getOrderRoundingMode(): that method answers for one order
 * at a time, so it cannot be consulted from SQL, and reading raw also keeps this
 * template working against a core that predates thelia/thelia#3801, where
 * order_rounding_mode is simply absent and the historical rule applies.
